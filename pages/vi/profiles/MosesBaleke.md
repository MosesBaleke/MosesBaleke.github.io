# Moses Baleke
Hi everyone, you can call me Moses. I am a junior at CSU-global majoring in computer science 
and I reside in Germantown Maryland. I am enthusiastic about programing and all modern web technologies. 
In addition to taking on rigorous programming projects such as, building my personal website, pursuing 
a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science has exposed me to some of the best programming and  industry 
practices that are needed to succeed as a Software Engineer. I always look forward to taking on new 
challenges/opportunities to further develop my skills and experience while working with everyone.
